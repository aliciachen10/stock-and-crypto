## Concept

 This app is a simple interface that combines a traditional stock dashboard with cryptocurrency data, displaying both in a similar time frame. When a stock or cypto symbol is entered in to their respective search box, a graph be will created showing the 100 day perfromance of that asset. The intent is for a user to view the two financial assets in a comparable way, letting them see a quick snapshot for the crypto and stock of their choice in a way that shows them as equals.

 Data for stock is pulled from the AlphaVantage API and crypto data is pulled form Polygon.io API

 Searches are saved in local storage so the user can see thier previous searches at a later time.
